# LockFS

**LockFS** is a simple, flexible app for encrypting files individually, keeping your data secure and your vaults manageable

## Requirements

- [Java](https://jdk.java.net/25/) - **The JVM must be installed, at least Java 21**

## Instructions

1. Download the latest `.jar` files from the [Releases](https://github.com/ghost-in-a-jar-00/lockfs/releases) page
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the program using the following command:

```
java -jar <program name>.jar
```

## Features

- **Granular Encryption**: Encrypt files one by one instead of bundling them in a single vault
- **Expandable Vaults**: Add files to your vault without worrying about it getting too large or fragmented
- **Cross-Storage Friendly**: Ideal for users managing multiple storage devices of different sizes
- **Secure and Reliable**: Uses robust encryption to keep your files safe

## Why LockFS?

Traditional vault systems often require compressing or archiving files before encrypting, which can make growing your vault cumbersome. LockFS lets you:

- Encrypt files individually for flexibility easily
- Avoid creating multiple fragmented vaults
- Easily manage and expand your encrypted storage over time
